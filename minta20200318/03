TÉTEL 3//////////////////////////////////////////:

My name is Csiribú but you can call me Csiri bácsi. I am 59 years old. I live in a small apartment a few blocks away from here.
I reason why I would like to apply to this job is because web-developer is the best field in Information Technology to work in.
I have completed my bachelor’s degree at Azkaban, Isengard. Under the years of my education I worked at a small IT company where
I could gather a lot of experience about managing PHP and HTML related tasks and environmental services. I have no problems solving a problem
regardless of it's difficulty and that's why I think I would be a great employee here.

Hope to hear from you soon.
