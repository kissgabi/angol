Version-control software are software specifically designed to make project development easier for developer teams. Version-control software are like
Git which is full of useful features. After creating a project you can choose to create a branch. Branches are a project's copied version that you can
edit at any time independently from the original project. The Project's current files are always in the "main" branch. If you've edited some files,
you can do a so called "pull-request" where to submit your branch. After checking the changes and updates in your submitted branch, the project owner can
"merge" your branch the main branch to update the project. This type of functionality makes it really easy to teams or in case of open-source software, community members
to contribute to a project. Every successful "pull-request" is called a "push". These contain the changes and notes with dates and version numbers that can help
keep tracing of our project. Every push is revertible and easy to use, or compare with other versions if you would like to do that.
