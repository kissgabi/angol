Dear XYZ,
I am Peter Griffin from MyLittlePonyIsNotPink software development company. I am happy to tell you that the newest version of our Storage-manager
application. You can download the newest version by going to www.mylittleponyisnotpink.com/updates/muchWow.html the site will require you to
type in the username and password to login. Use the username "omai_wamo_shindeiru" with the password "nani".
After logging in, click on "new Updates" and download the .zip file that suits your needs. Choose "muchWow_x64" for 64 bit operating system
or "muchWow_x86" if you are using a 32bit operating system. After downloading, simply execute the "not_a_virus.exe" and the software will update
automatically. As you will see, we've added a new button to delete everything that you can press accidentally and a new list that will crash immediately if 
you try to click it. You are welcome!
Sincerly,
Peter Griffin.
