Dear ZXY,
I heard you want a management program. If I recall correctly your expectation for it's platform is a Desktop version. I would like to recommend you to
consider buying a Web-based applications. Desktop applications are very limited in terms of compatibility, security and user-friendliness.
Desktop applications are limited to PCs with a specific operating system, the security of a Desktop application is always weaker then a web-based app.
Web applications are just as easy to use as Desktop applications but web apps can be used universally on every device with most browsers. Your applications
requires internet connection anyway, so why not choose a secure, user friendly, platform independent web application. A Desktop application requires
updating every single installed version that is a lot more data- and time-wasting activity. Web apps however do not require updating.
Every user will see the newest version of the application that makes operating the application and patching nearly instant. With the correct security steps
that our company uses, security will not be a problem while you are providing a user firendly, time efficient, platform independent application to your employees
to use. I hope you will reconsider this idea. 
Sincerely,
Lightning McQueen
