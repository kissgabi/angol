Today’s market of phones, tablets and different types of devices is really big. Thus the screen size of different devices
of different brands varies. The variety of size to resolution ratios is large and this makes responsive web development really hard.
The preferred resolutions ratio is 16:9 or 9:16 for phones and hand devices. Different resolutions can cause size and position problems for
web elements but that can be solved it relative calculations of the resolution. As for the aspect-ratios we have no other choice but to the current
web page on as many aspect-ratios as we can. Starting with the most popular ones to the least popular ones. We can not solve every scenario
but that's how we can do our best to make it work in most cases.
