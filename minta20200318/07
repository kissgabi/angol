Dear XZ,
As the Producer of the game development project, I would recommend you to hire new employees to our Development team. We need a Designer who could design the
game's main gameplay flow and structure. A senior game designer with 2-3 years experience could be great in our team. We need Artists who could represent the ideas
and visually, any junior artist would be great, they work for a lower salary and the art styles are always changing to someone new could be an excellent part of our team.
As for the Programmers, the requirement has to be at least 2 years of experience in game-engine development with C++ We need programmers who are able to work
with multiple Sound-,Graphics- and Physics-engines. We need level designers who have experience with 3D level design and 3D design programs. We need the programmers and
Designers at all time, but the Artists and Tester can wait until the actual idea is born.
Sincerly,
Chewbacca
