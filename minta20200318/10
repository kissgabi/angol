Az OOP azaz Obect Oriented Programming is a programming model that contains "Objects" which are data groups in the memory. An Object has is part of a Class.
Every Class has it's own variables and functions. With OOP, you are able to give every individual object a variable. These variables are either public, or private.
Public variables are accessible from outside the Class functions are modifiable. Private variables are only modifiable by class methods. This helps us hide
variables that are not intended to be used outside of the class, and thus prevent possible errors and bugs. Classes contain functions that are only available
for their objects. We refer to these functions and "Virtual Methods". OOP helps with writing code, and code readability as oppose to for example sequential programming.
