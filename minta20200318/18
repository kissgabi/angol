Our company is totally imaginary and it's great. For example, my team is the best because we always finish on time and we get FAT paychecks.
Debugging here is necessary because we can't code. Debugging is the process of using a so-called "Debugger" to step through the code flow
and check variable types, values, addresses all in real time. Debuggers are the best friends of a programmer. You have to attach the debugger to the process
after that, the program will be in a so called "Debugger" environment. This helps us to solve bugs really easily and time efficiently. 
For example when an ‘if’ statement fails, we can check it's reason with debugger really easily by stepping through the program lines and keeping an eye out for the
variables' values. Using a debugger is useful and quite easy. We will help you get started.
