Dear XYZ,
I am writing to you because our client Spongebob Squarepants didn't like the search bar and we have to remake it based on his new expectations.
Sadly this is not our only problem. The class that manages the ‘krabby pattie’ lists has to be heavily modified because Mr. Krabs uses a new
import file type to store data. Our designer got sick so we can't start updating the search bar. We will start to work on new list
managing class but we need time. It will cause approximately a week delay compared to the original release date. The option would be to
send a new designer to replace Dave until he gets better. With the help of the replacement designer we could finish the project earlier.
Please let me know if this is possible.
Sincerly,
Squidward
