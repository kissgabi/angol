TÃ‰TEL 6//////////////////////////////////////////:

Dear XY, My name is XZ and I work as a project manager at Lincos. It is important to have an accurate warehouse inventory at all times.
Our inventory managing program is capable of managing every activity in real-time. After an online order comes in, it is recorded and logged in the program.
Once the order is completed, the program will automatically update the number of items in the database.
Thanks to the automated backup feature power outage will mean no trouble, no data or log will be lost.
If you choose our product, you will not regret it thanks to the above-mentioned features, our software represents great value for the price.
Thank you for reading my letter.
Sincerely, 
XZ
