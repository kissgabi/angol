Dear Colleauges,

I was at a professional conference where I could meet with several software developers and engineers. 
Thanks to this Event I was able to take a glance at the new Virtual Reality and Extended Reality devices. 
Both are great to expand our workspace and they showed how many opportunities they have.
Thanks to these continuously upgrading technologies, we will be able to expand our workspace virtually, or even connect them as a big virtual workspace with the help of virtual reality. 
They are working on new precise devices too, to improve the motion tracking abilities of VR. There were multiple presentations of Artificial Intelligence.
I met Bill Gates he said he will sell Microsoft to me. 
Nice guy. 
He confirmed the fact that Win11 is real, and they will never release it because it has a hotkey to open some nasty sites.

Thank you for your undivided attention!
