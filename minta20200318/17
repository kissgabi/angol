TÉTEL 17//////////////////////////////////////////:

Firstly, we will ask our designer to design the face of the website. We will keep on adjusting it based on your needs. This will take about a week at max.
After that, we will know what the user has to see, so we can start developing the database's structure and it's managing layer. If we've made sure
there is everything perfectly fine with every file type, and the encoding is right, we will hand the project to our Web developer team.
They will make sure to make everything exactly how you imagined. Both in the client side, and server side. After this our testers will try every single
possibility of how the site could be used and write a report about it. If everything goes great, the last step is to ask our security leaders to do a
penetration test on the site. If everything works well, and we can be sure it's security is flawless, you can get the project instantly.
