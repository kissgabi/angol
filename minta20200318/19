TÃ‰TEL 19//////////////////////////////////////////:

My name is Mickey Mouse. I am 69 years old. I have a Master's Degree of computer science. I've graduated from Cookie Monster's Computer University.
I have 20 years of experience with different game, sound, rendering, physics systems that I've gathered throughout the years at Sesame Street.
I am currently the lead developer of a new upcoming 3D game called "Pick a Cake". But I've also worked on "Don't call the police".
The reason why I would like to work at your company is because I could be a great member of your game development team. Also my current boss pays me in
IOU (I owe you) cards.
Sincerely,
Mickey Mouse
