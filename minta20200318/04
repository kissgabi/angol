Comparing Operation Systems is not too easy, so I am going to divide it to 2 main branches of the Operation System tree.
These are the Windows and the Linux based Operation systems. 
Even though they have many variants and versions, the main comparing aspects are Security, User-friendliness, Compatibility and Capabilities. 
Windows is a paid operating system that has a great variety of user-friendly tools and device support thanks to it's popularity. 
It's important not to forget that thanks to this level of popularity the system has numerous security flaws but with the help of 3rd party anti-cheat software it's a lot easier to keep our systems safe. 
The user doesn't have full control over the system, on the other hand, the Linux OS with it's increasing popularity, and open source code, gives total control over our system. With great power comes great responsibility so it's Linux is not the most user-friendly system, but it's an excellent OS for developers or anyone else who spent some time learning it's control.
Thanks to the open-source code, the community can help improving the systems code that results in a clean, secure operating system.
Windows is the best operating system if you want a ready-to-go user-friendly system for any particular day, and Linux is the best for anyone who decides to learn to use a clean, secure operating system with great performance.
