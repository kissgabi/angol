Dear Manager,

I am writing this with the intent of asking for a new computer in my office.
Sadly the current configuration is not fast enough to deal with the new 64bit programs that are required to
finish my job on time. 
Since the programs are mostly 64bit and most of the projects that we are working on use multithreading I would suggest the AMD manufacturer's Ryzen 7 3800X Processor which has the best multithreading value for it's relatively low price what you might be able to upgrade the current configuration in my office from.
It would be a big help if we could upgrade the current single channel 4GB RAM to dual channel of 16GB RAM.
The current storage device is a 300GB HDD but it would be a lot better to upgrade to a 1TB HDD for storage and at least 500GB SSD as an active storage device.
The upgrade of the power supply is necessary and I would highly suggest that too, just to make the PC a bit more
future proof in your company's workspace.

Sincerly yours, X;
