TÃ‰TEL 14//////////////////////////////////////////:

Dear Client,

Agile software development is a method of scheduling a goal for every week. We are constantly communicating with other sub-groups who are working on your project.
We push updates every week and update our next goal. We talk about new ideas at the time and divide the main projects so the groups can work on something 
simultaneously. Our project manager will keep you updated of our actions and he will listen to your ideas. Your tasks in this period of time will be to
test the newest software version if it works as intended, and if it meets your expectations. Between testing, as I've said, our project manager will keep in touch with
you and that can consume a lot of your time but it's necessary. If everything happens as described it to you, you will get the exact program that you've imagined.
Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
XY
